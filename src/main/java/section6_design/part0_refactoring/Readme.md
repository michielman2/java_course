# Refactoring

For all these exercises you should solve these assignments using refactoring techniques.
This may (or may not) involve any refactoring technique:  

- renaming
- extracting methods, (inner) classes, enums
- implementing a design pattern

## Exercise 1

In this package you will find class `Rectangle` (and its associated inner classes View and Point) that is quite smelly.
It is your job to refactor this class so that it adheres to the basic OO design principles (especially the SOLID principles).
There is an associated test class `RectangleTest` that you can use to test and demonstrate your refactoring.
These tests are correct as they are - the functionality in itself is OK and needs not be changed.

## Exercise 2
You should modify class `GlobalAligner` in such a way that the general contract stays the same, but it adheres better to Java and OOP programming rules and best practices.

This may involve any refactoring technique, including

- renaming
- extracting methods, (inner) classes, enums
- implementing a design pattern
- whatever else you think is a good idea


# Refactoring project

Clone this repo [refactoringtrainingproject](https://github.com/MichielNoback/refactoringtrainingproject).
Continue the refactoring process according to the instructions in the Readme.md of that repo. The code base is more or less functional
as it is, so it may be a good idea to start by thinking about top-level JUnit tests to guarantee functionality is not broken, and then
start your work on the main class, `GffQuery`. To begin with a blank slate, check out tag 0.2 of branch master (commit `19a08f4`)
